This is a markdown file explaining things I did not previously understand in Pokémon GO.

## Mega Evolution
### Mega Evolving the first time
To Mega Evolve a Pokémon the first time, you have to (obviously) have that Pokémon, as well as sufficient Mega Energy for that Pokémon. It will stay Mega Evolved for a set amount of time, before it goes back to its original form.

### Getting Mega Energy
You can get Mega Energy with two methods:
1. Battling that Mega Pokémon in Mega Raids. This will award you 150-250 Mega Energy per raid. Don't worry, you'll get this regardless of if you catch the Pokémon.
2. Walking a Pokémon in the family of a Pokémon you've *previously* Mega Evolved. For example, walking a Slowbro before you've ever Mega Evolved a Slowbro will not earn you any Mega Energy, but Walking a Larvitar after you Mega Evolved a Tyranitar will. This will award you 5 Mega Energy per kilometer.

### Mega Evolution Cooldown
After the Pokémon's Mega Evolution runs out, it will be on cooldown for a set amount of time. This cooldown will depend on how many times you've Mega Evolved the Pokémon in the past. See the chart below.
| Mega Evolution Count | Cooldown Length |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| 1 - 7 times          | 7 days          |
| 8 - 30 times         | 5 days          |
| 31+ times            | 3 days          |

### Mega Evolving multiple times
Mega Evolving after the first time is free! That is, unless you'd like to bypass the cooldown. In which case, you'll need to forfeit some Mega Energy.

### FAQ
#### Q: Once I Mega Evolve one Pokémon, can I Mega Evolve other Pokémon of the same species free of charge?
A: Nope! If you Mega Evolve one Tyranitar, you'll have to spend the same amount of Mega Energy to Mega Evolve another one.

#### Q: How much Mega Energy does skipping the cooldown cost?
A: I have no idea.

#### Q: Can I Mega Evolve more than one Pokémon at the same time?
A: No. If you try and do so, you'll forfeit your time with the first Mega Pokémon, and their cooldown will begin early.

### Tips and Tricks
This is just what I do to make my life easier regarding Megas.
- If you have a Pokémon that *can* Mega Evolve (and you've done so less than 30 times), go ahead and Mega Evolve it. The more times you Mega Evolve it, the shorter your cooldown becomes. That is, unless you think you'll need that particular Mega in the near future.
- If there's a Mega Pokémon in raids at the moment that you *don't have*, try as hard as you can to snag enough to Mega Evolve before it goes out of rotation. Once you Mega Evolve it once, you have your renewable source of Mega Energy (walking).
